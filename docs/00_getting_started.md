# Getting Started

## Prebuilt Binaries

The fastest way to get started with Bonsai is to grab the prebuilt binaries from
the [Latest Releases](../../releases/latest) page.  Windows and Linux are supported.


## Running an Example

Bonsai ships with several pre-built example projects, under the `bin/game_libs`
folder.  To run an example, simply launch `bin/game_loader.exe` and select the
example from the menu presented.  Alternatively, you may specify which example
to run from a command line as an argument.  For example,
`bin/game_loader.exe bin/game_libs/terrain_gen_loadable.dll`

## Terrain Generation

The terrain_gen example provides users with a convenient playground for
experimenting with terrain generation.  Just fire up your favorite editor,
navigate to `shaders/terrain/shaping/default.fragmentshader`, and edit away!
Terrain shaders hot-reload, so you have a fast edit-compile-run loop for
experimentation.
